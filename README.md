# Sprint Review and Retrospective - SNHU Travel Application

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

Interpreting user needs requires clear communication with stakeholders and translating their requirements into actionable tasks. For the SNHU Travel application, user stories were instrumental in this process. Each user story captured specific user needs in a structured format, such as "As a customer, I want to search for flights by destination and date, so that I can plan my trip." This approach ensured that the team understood the user’s goals and created features aligned with those objectives. User stories also provided clear acceptance criteria, which guided the development process and ensured deliverables met user expectations.

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs is rooted in iterative and incremental development, as demonstrated in the SNHU Travel project. Agile processes like Scrum were pivotal. Sprint Planning sessions helped prioritize tasks, while Daily Standups kept the team aligned. Sprint Reviews enabled us to gather stakeholder feedback and refine features. In my future work, I aim to continue using Agile practices, particularly backlog refinement, test-driven development (TDD), and collaborative tools like Jira and Git. These practices ensure flexibility, maintain code quality, and foster a culture of continuous improvement.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means actively contributing to the team’s success while supporting others. In the SNHU Travel project, collaboration was key. Developers used pair programming to solve complex problems and reviewed each other’s code to maintain high standards. Effective communication through tools like Jira and Slack ensured transparency and accountability. Additionally, participating in Sprint Retrospectives helped identify areas for improvement, demonstrating a commitment to both personal and team growth. A good team member values collaboration, respects diverse perspectives, and is adaptable to changing project needs.
